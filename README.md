## Requirements
1. This is built from using pipenv, please see Pipfile.
2. However this also requires [humaniki-schema](https://github.com/notconfusing/humaniki-schema), which in development mode, must be in a sibling directory to humaniki-backend.
    2. you can have Pycharm autocomplete for you out of humaniki-schema by going to file->settings->project->structure, and adding a new content root.
